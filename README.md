# Atlas.Statement

Provides query statement builders for MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL
Server. The statements are independent of any particular database connection,
though they work best with [PDO](https://php.net/pdo), query performers such as
[Atlas.Query](http://atlasphp.io/dymaxion/query), or PDO wrappers such as
[Atlas.Pdo](http://atlasphp.io/dymaxion/pdo).
